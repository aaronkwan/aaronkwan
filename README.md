# Hi there. 👋

### Welcome to my GitHub!

### I've been busy exploring the realm of software development.

### Check out my [latest project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-synced-object), where I developed a performant node.js package for state synchronization within a react app.

### Stay tuned for more updates!

### - Aaron
